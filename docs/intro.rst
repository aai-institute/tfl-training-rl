About this documentation
========================

Welcome to the documentation of the tfl-training-rl training.
It contains the executed exercise notebooks and the documentation
of the source code. Note that some links to source code files inside
the rendered exercises might be broken, since the linking mechanism
is different in jupyter and the rendered documentation.


TODO: Add more information about the training here!
