    "There are various approaches, but the core idea is to strike a balance where the policy distribution remains reasonably close to the behavioral one while also improving its performance. This involves introducing some distributional shift to enhance the policy without going out of distribution, all while ensuring that the effective sample size remains large enough to be representative during inference. Achieving this balance is a challenging task and a highly active area of research in the RL community.\n",
