# Safe and Efficient RL - Notebook Pages

Welcome to the Safe and Efficient RL jupyter book. 
These pages contain all rendered notebooks and serve
as a reference. Feel free to look around!

If you want to execute or edit the notebooks, install
the requirements (or use docker) and start jupyter 
as described in the `README.md`.
