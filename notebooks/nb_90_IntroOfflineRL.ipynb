    "    \n",
    "**Decision's Making in Health Care**: In healthcare, we can use Markov decision processes to model the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Actions are interventions like tests and treatments, while observations are patient symptoms and test results. Offline RL is safer and more practical than active RL, as treating patients directly with partially trained policies is risky.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Robotic Manipulation Skills**: In robotics, we can use active RL for skill learning, but generalizing skills across different environments is challenging. Offline RL allows us to reuse previously collected data from various skills to accelerate learning of new skills. For example, making soup with onions and carrots can build on experiences with onions and meat or carrots and cucumbers, reducing the need for new data collection.\n",

If the data belongs to the behavioral policy distribution, it should be added since it could lead the agent to a high-reward region.\n",
