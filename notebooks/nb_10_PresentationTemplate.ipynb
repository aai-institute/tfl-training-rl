    "\n",
    "To make the notebook prettier and more functional, we use some \n",
    "[jupyter extensions](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Equation numbering* for rendering numbers and links to equations. So this works:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\mathcal{X}= \\{1, \\dots, N \\} \\label{x_def}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Now we can refer to the equation as: $\\ref{x_def}$. Note however that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You have to use `\\begin{equation} ... \\end{equation}`, just `$$` won't work.\n",
    "- Sometimes things will have to be refreshed, use the button `Reset equation numbering` in the toolbar.\n",
    "- Links to equations don't work in presentation mode.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. *Hinterland* for immediate autocompletion (without `Tab`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Spellchecker* (most extensions won't work in an IDE, so you will probably write quite a lot directly from the notebook interface). You should probably always keep it on.\n",
    "4. The *toc2* extension for a table of contents (in TfL style). This extension is a bit buggy on Windows (on linux or inside docker everything is fine), but still usable and of value. It also provides a `Navigation` button in the toolbar which works fine on any OS. **Important**: The ToC does not automatically disappear when going into presentation mode. Thus, before opening presentation mode, first close the ToC. For using the ToC on Windows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - When the ToC is first opened, drag the resize button a bit to make it actually turn into a sidebar.\n",
    "    - When it is closed, the remaining jupyter window doesn't resize automatically. Drag the browser and maximize it again to trigger resizing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. *Initialization cells*. Nice extension to define which cells should be executed automatically as the notebook is loaded or the kernel is restarted. We use it to automatically load styles and data. In order to mark cells as initialization cells, go to `View -> Cell Toolbar -> Initialization Cell`. Switch back to viewing `Slideshow` after.\n",
    "6. *Hide input*. Used in conjunction with initialization and with the `%%capture` magic command which also hides output for hiding style and data loading from the users. Note that the cells don't fully disappear, they are turned into a single white line. Select the white line and untoggle it with the `^` button in the toolbar to view and edit it. Only works on code cells.\n",
    "7. The *exercise2* extension for displaying hints and solutions"

    "# Handling data\n",
    "\n",
    "We use [accsr](https://github.com/appliedAI-Initiative/accsr) \n",
    "for downloading and uploading data from/to a bucket. As recipient of the template.\n",
    "there is very little that you have to do to make everything work.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Either set the env-var `TFL_STORAGE_ADMIN_SECRET` or overwrite the `secret` entry in (the gitignored) `config_local.yml`. Ask someone for the value, in case you don't have it.\n",
    "2. Structure your data as `data/first_nb`, `data/second_nb` etc. This will allow to download data selectively, and thus not force users to download all data if they just want to execute a single notebook after the workshop. You can also have a `data/common` directory.\n",
    "3. Once data is stored on your disc, call `python scripts/upload_data.py` to upload everything to the cloud. If you made changes to files and want to overwrite them, call `python scripts/upload_data.py -f`. Don't worry about doing this repeatedly, accsr takes care of never re-uploading or downloading everything.\n",
    "4. In notebooks, include magic commands a la `%download_data first_nb` in hidden initialization cells, like done here. This ensures that required data will be pulled when the user opens the notebook. Calling  `%download_data` without an argument will download everything.\n",
    "5. During the actual presentation, data will be downloaded on every spun-up server automatically in the background. Thus, users can get started right away. This is realized by calling the `download_data.py` script as part of the entrypoint. For everything to go smoothly, ask the workshop participants to spin up a server right away when the workshop begins. Then all downloads should finish during the introductory first presentation.\n"
